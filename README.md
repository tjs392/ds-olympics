# DS Olympics

DS Olympics is a collection of high-performance data structures I'm creating and benchmarking against other libs

## Goals

- Develop highly efficient, cache-friendly data structures optimized for small objects.
- Minimize memory overhead and allocations to maximize throughput.
- Compare performance against standard library and popular third-party implementations.
- Explore lock-free and low-latency concurrency patterns suitable for multi-threaded workloads.
- Provide reusable, well-tested components for educational, research, and experimental purposes.
- Maintain clean and consistent API design for easy integration and benchmarking.
